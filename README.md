This is a music mixer I made in tkinter using the thread, pyDub, pyAudio, wave, and time modules. When the program ran, the user was shown a screen with trees, rivers, and mountains which acted as sound objects. Every time the user clicked on a sound object, i.e. a tree, the tree would simultaneously become animated and produce a sound on loop. Clicking on multiple sound objects created multiple animations and sound overlays, and effectively let the user customize their melodies. 

I have included the file “TermProjectFinalDraft.py” which contains all the code in the project, as well pdf files of my calculations and designs of the trees, rivers, and mountains.
